One variety of amaranth is grown for its leaves, which are called Chinese spinach.",amaranth,Amaranthus,"['millet', 'quinoa', 'buckwheat groats']"
1,arborio rice,"This plump white rice can absorb lots of water without getting mushy, so it's perfect for making risotto.  The best comes from Italy.  Arborio is very well-regarded",Piedmont rice,"Oryza sativa, Japonica","['Spanish rice', 'short-grain rice', 'pearl barley', 'medium-grain rice']"
2,baby corn,"These are tiny ears of corn that are eaten cob and all.  Asian cooks like to add them to stir-fried dishes, and they often show up in salad bars.  It's hard to find them fresh, but many markets sell them in cans or jars.","Chinese baby corn, corn, baby",Zea mays,"['corn', 'Barley']"
3,Barley,"Barley's been feeding humans for millennia, though it fell out of favor during the last one as people came to see it as low-brow peasant fare.   It's most often used in soups and stews, where it serves as both a puffy grain and a thickener, but it also makes a nice side dish or salad.  At most markets, you'll have to choose between two types of barley.  Hulled barley is the most nutritious, since only the tough outer hulls are polished off.  Pearl barley is polished some more, so that the outer bran layer is also scrubbed off.  It's less nutritious, but more popular since it's not as chewy as hulled barley and it cooks faster.",,Hordeum vulgare,"['pearl barley', 'buckwheat groats', 'spelt']"
4,barley flakes,"To make this, barley kernels are sliced, then rolled flat into flakes.  Like rolled oats, rolled barley is usually served as a hot cereal.  It takes about 30 minutes to cook.","flaked barley, rolled barley",Hordeum vulgare,['rolled oats']

6,basmati rice,"This aromatic, long-grain rice is grown in the foothills of the Himalayas and is especially popular in India.  The cooked grains are dry and fluffy, so they make a nice bed for curries and sauces. Basmati is available as either white or brown rice.  Brown basmati has more fiber and a stronger flavor, but it takes twice as long to cook.   Aged basmati rice is better, but more expensive.",,Oryza,"['popcorn rice', 'jasmine rice', 'long-grain rice', 'wild pecan rice']"
7,Bhutanese red rice,"This red short-grain rice is a staple in rural areas of Bhutan, a small kingdom nestled high in the Himalayas.

12,bomba rice,"Bomba is a type of rice prized for its starchy center, which can absorb three times its volume of cooking liquid. It is often used in paella. It retains distinct short grains after cooking.","arròs bomba, arroz bomba, Valencia rice",Oryza sativa,"['arborio rice', 'Calasparra rice', 'jasmine rice']"
13,bran,"This is the made from the outer husk of the grain, and it's a rich source of fiber.  There are two types of fiber:  insoluble fiber, which passes right through us undigested, and soluble fiber, which is digested by friendly bacteria in our intestines.  Insoluble fiber is found in wheat bran and corn bran, and it's good for flushing out the intestines.  Soluble fiber, found in oat bran, makes you feel full, so it's good for dieters",polishings,,['legumes']
14,brown rice,"Many rice varieties come as either brown rice or white rice.  Brown rice isn't milled as much as white, so it retains the bran and germ. That makes brown rice more fiber-rich, nutritious, and chewy.   Unfortunately, it doesn't perform as well as white rice in many recipes.  Long grains of brown rice aren't as fluffy and tender, and short grains aren't as sticky.  Brown rice also takes about twice as long to cook and has a much shorter shelf life (because of the oil in the germ).  Keep it in a cool, dark place for not more than three months. Refrigeration can extend shelf life.",whole grain rice,Oryza sativa,"['converted rice', 'wild pecan rice', 'white rice']"
15,buckwheat,"Buckwheat is gluten-free, and loaded with nutrients, especially protein, and it has a nutty, earthy flavor. It's most commonly ground into a dark, gritty flour and used to make everything from pancakes to soba noodles. Eastern Europeans also like their buckwheat crushed into small groats, which they toast in oil and use to make side dishes and breakfast cereals.",,Fagopyrum esculentum,['all-purpose flour']

17,buckwheat groats,"These are buckwheat kernels that are stripped of their inedible outer coating and then crushed into smaller pieces.  Unprocessed white groats are slightly bitter, so before you cook them it's a good idea to toast them in oil for several minutes until they're rust-colored.  This removes the bitterness and brings out a pleasant, nutty flavor.  If you don't want to do this yourself, you can buy already roasted groats, called kasha.",,Fagopyrum esculentum,"['kasha', 'millet', 'amaranth seeds', 'quinoa']"
18,bulgur,"Bulgur is made from whole wheat that's been soaked and baked to speed up the cooking time. It's especially popular in the Middle East, where it's used to make tabouli and pilafs.

19,Calasparra rice,Calasparra rice like bomba rice is very absorbent and often used in paella.,arroz de Calasparra,Oryza,"['bomba rice', 'arborio rice']"
20,converted rice,"This is a good compromise between nutritious brown rice and tender, fast-cooking white rice.  Converted rice is steamed before it's husked, a process that causes the grains to absorb many of the nutrients from the husk.  When cooked, the grains are more nutritious, firmer, and less clingy than white rice grains.   Uncle Ben's is a well-known brand.",parboiled rice,Oryza sativa,"['brown rice', 'white rice']"
21,corn,"This is the only grain that's commonly eaten as a fresh vegetable.  Native to the Americas, corn is a great source of vitamin A, fiber, and other nutrients.
When corn comes into season during the summer, it's common to see people in supermarkets peeling back husks in search of ears with perfect rows of kernels.  Don't do that yourself.  Crooked rows taste just as good as straight, and keeping the husk on helps the corn stay sweet.  Freshness is a better criterion, since the sugars in corn begin converting into starch the moment it's picked.  The best test is to sample some kernels.   Frozen corn kernels are a good substitute when fresh corn is out of season, but canned corn is only a fair substitute.","maize, sweet corn",Zea mays,"['barley flakes', 'garden pea']"

Southern cooks usually boil whole or ground hominy until it's tender, and then they serve it in much the same way that Northern cooks would serve potatoes.  Varieties include lye hominy, which is made by soaking corn kernels in a weak lye bath, and pearl hominy, which is made by crushing corn kernels mechanically.   White hominy is made from white corn kernels, and the sweeter yellow hominy is made from yellow.  Samp is coarsely ground or broken hominy, while hominy grits are more finely ground.  You can buy hominy canned or dried.","posole, pozole",Zea mays,"['barley grits', 'dried beans', 'buckwheat', 'potato']"

45,long-grain rice,"Long-grain rice has slender grains that stay separate and fluffy after cooking, so this is the best choice if you want to serve rice as a side dish, or as a bed for sauces.  American long-grain rice (which includes Carolina rice) has a somewhat bland flavor, and is what cookbooks usually have in mind when they call for long-grain rice. Patna rice is a mild rice grown in India.  Basmati rice, another Indian import, has a nutty taste and goes well with many Indian and Middle Eastern dishes. Jasmine rice is also aromatic, and usually less expensive than Basmati. It often accompanies Thai and Vietnamese dishes. Americans have crossed Basmati with American long-grain rice to get popcorn rice, which is milder and less expensive than basmati.  Another hybrid is wild pecan rice, which retain most of the bran for a nutty, chewy flavor.",long grain rice,Oryza sativa,['medium-grain rice']

Rice is classified mostly by the size of the grain. Long-grain rice is long and slender. The grains stay separate and fluffy after cooking, so this is the best choice if you want to serve rice as a side dish, or as a bed for sauces. Medium-grain rice is shorter and plumper, and works well in paella and risotto.   Short-grain rice is almost round, with moist grains that stick together when cooked. It's the best choice for rice pudding and molded salads.  Other specialty varieties include Spanish rice for paella, glutinous rice for sushi and rice balls, and risotto rice for risotto. Most varieties are sold as either brown or white rice, depending upon how they are milled.   Brown rice retains the bran that surrounds the kernel, making it chewier, nuttier, and richer in nutrients.   White rice lacks the bran and germ, but is more tender and delicate. It's less nutritious than brown rice, but you can partially compensate for that by getting enriched white rice. Brown rice takes about twice as long to cook as white rice. Converted rice is beige. It tastes a lot like white rice, but it has more nutrients. Instant rice is white rice that's been precooked and dehydrated.
